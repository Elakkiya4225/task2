User Interface (UI): The app typically starts with a clean and user-friendly design, showing essential data like current temperature, weather conditions, and location. It may have features like animations for different weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow).

Location Access: The app needs access to the user's location to provide accurate weather data. It can use GPS, WiFi, or manual location input.

Weather API: The core of any weather app is a weather API (Application Programming Interface). APIs like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack provide real-time weather data. The app sends requests to these APIs to fetch weather information based on the user's location.

Data Parsing and Display: The app parses the received data to display it in a human-readable format. This includes current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast for the next few days.

Additional Features: Advanced weather apps include features like weather alerts, radar maps, air quality indexes, and even integration with smart home devices to adjust heating/cooling based on the weather.
